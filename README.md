# Finance-Projects
This repository highlights my finance-related projects, with a focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and sustainable finance. As a data science and analytics enthusiast, I leverage AI, Machine Learning, and statistical models to drive insights and promote sustainable decision-making in the financial sector. My work aims to contribute to the integration of sustainability principles into finance, supporting efforts towards achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)."
